# SudokuSchool
SudokuSchool is a WIP program that will analyze a sudoku board. It will point out the value of the easiest cell to solve, as well as the logic used.

Potential Future Features:
1. Hints - Instead of just pointing out the next move and the reasoning, SudokuSchool will offer progressively larger hints.
2. Streamlined Input - Snip an image of your sudoku to autofill puzzle values.
3. Solve Irregular Boards - Add the ability to solve boards that are not 9x9.
